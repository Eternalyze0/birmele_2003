The statement claims that if every pair of cycles of length at least \(k\) in a graph share at least one common vertex, then there exists a set of \(k\) vertices that intersects every such cycle. However, this is not true for all \(k\), as demonstrated by a counterexample for \(k = 1\).

Consider a graph with three 4-cycles defined as follows:
- Cycle \(C_{12}\) on vertices \(v_1, p, v_2, q\) with edges \(v_1 - p - v_2 - q - v_1\).
- Cycle \(C_{13}\) on vertices \(v_1, r, v_3, s\) with edges \(v_1 - r - v_3 - s - v_1\).
- Cycle \(C_{23}\) on vertices \(v_2, t, v_3, u\) with edges \(v_2 - t - v_3 - u - v_2\).

All vertices are distinct. The graph has no smaller cycles (e.g., no triangles), as there are no direct edges like \(v_1 - v_2\), \(v_1 - v_3\), or \(v_2 - v_3\).

For \(k = 1\), the cycles of length at least 1 include all cycles in the graph (since the minimum cycle length is 3, but \(k = 1\) includes all cycles regardless). Thus, the relevant cycles are \(C_{12}\), \(C_{13}\), and \(C_{23}\), each of length 4.

- \(C_{12}\) and \(C_{13}\) share vertex \(v_1\).
- \(C_{12}\) and \(C_{23}\) share vertex \(v_2\).
- \(C_{13}\) and \(C_{23}\) share vertex \(v_3\).

Therefore, every pair of cycles of length at least 1 (i.e., all cycles) shares a common vertex, satisfying the premise.

However, there is no single vertex common to all three cycles:
- \(v_1\) is in \(C_{12}\) and \(C_{13}\) but not \(C_{23}\).
- \(v_2\) is in \(C_{12}\) and \(C_{23}\) but not \(C_{13}\).
- \(v_3\) is in \(C_{13}\) and \(C_{23}\) but not \(C_{12}\).
- The private vertices (\(p, q, r, s, t, u\)) are each in only one cycle.

Thus, no vertex is present in all three cycles, meaning there is no set of size \(k = 1\) that intersects every cycle of length at least 1.

This counterexample shows that the statement does not hold for \(k = 1\). While it may hold for larger \(k\) in specific graphs, the general statement is false as stated for all \(k\), due to the failure at \(k = 1\).

\boxed{\text{disproven}}
